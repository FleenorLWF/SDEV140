# Write a python program with the following requirements:

# Reads an integer from propted user input until the user enters 0.

# When zero is entered as the first integer prompt the user that the first number cannot be zero and resume input number prompting

# When zero is entered at any point other than the first integer, the program should then output;

# 1) Print the list of integers, 2) Print the count of numbers that were entered, 3)  Print the maximum number value entered (the largest number entered) with output descriptions

# The program should also check to make sure the first number entered is not zero and handle input validation like input not being an integer etc.
