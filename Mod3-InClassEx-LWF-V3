# SDEV 140 - Mod 3 - in class excercise


# Write a python program with the following requirements:

# Reads an integer from propted user input until the user enters 0.

# When zero is entered as the first integer prompt the user that the first number cannot be zero and resume input number prompting

# When zero is entered at any point other than the first integer, the program should then output;

# 1) Print the list of integers, 2) Print the count of numbers that were entered, 3)  Print the maximum number value entered (the largest number entered) with output descriptions

# The program should also check to make sure the first number entered is not zero and handle input validation like input not being an integer etc.


# Begin code:

# Create list

numbers = []   # this list will be used to store all valid integers


# This section sets up the loop to gather and process the integers
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter an integer (Enter 0 to stop and process list): ")


# This section is used to validate input
    try:
        num = int(user_input)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid User Input. Please enter only integers.")
        continue




# This section checks to see if this is the first number and if it is zero
    if len(numbers) == 0 and num == 0:
        print("The first number cannot be zero. Please enter a non-zero integer.")
        continue



# This section provides the break action if zero is entered after the first number, stop input
    if num == 0:
        break


# IF integer input is not zero, then store the number in the list
    numbers.append(num)



# This section produces the output desired
# When the break character is entered, the loop ends, and the results are printed.
print("\nIntegers entered:", numbers)
print("Total count of numbers entered:", len(numbers))


# This section outputs the value of the largest integer entered.
if len(numbers) > 0:
    print("Maximum number value entered:", max(numbers))

# End Code - Done.
